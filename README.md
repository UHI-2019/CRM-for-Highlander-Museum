Repository for the Highlander Museum CRM

## Setup Guide

1. I would recommend installing gitbash [here](https://gitforwindows.org/) for working in the command-line.
2. Follow the steps outlined [here](https://laravel.com/docs/6.x#installation) to get a basic Laravel project up and running.
3. Once you know a Laravel project will run on your local machine, clone master, navigate to the 'crm' folder using gitbash
(or similar) and run 'composer update'. Then run 'php artisan serve' and copy the URL into your browser. It is usually
   127.0.0.1:8000 but can differ.
   
A MySql database has been setup on Azure for testing so no need to get anything running locally if you don't want to. [This](https://laracasts.com/series/laravel-from-scratch-2018 ) is a
great series for learning the basics of Laravel: but otherwise the [docs](https://laravel.com/docs/6.x) are brilliant.
